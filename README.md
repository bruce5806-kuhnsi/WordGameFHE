# WordGameFHE

A fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) powered on-chain word puzzle game where all player guesses and the target word remain encrypted throughout gameplay. Smart contracts verify guesses using encrypted computation, ensuring that no one ‚Äî not even the contract operator ‚Äî can see the actual words. WordGameFHE brings privacy, fairness, and transparency to the world of blockchain-based word games.

## Overview

WordGameFHE is inspired by classic word guessing games like Wordle, but rebuilt for the decentralized web using privacy-preserving cryptography.  
In traditional blockchain games, every player action is publicly visible, making private gameplay impossible. WordGameFHE solves this by integrating **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, allowing the contract to perform all game logic directly on ciphertexts.

Each player‚Äôs guess, the challenge word, and even intermediate evaluations are encrypted. The blockchain confirms correctness without ever decrypting data. This ensures that gameplay is **verifiable but private**, **competitive yet transparent**, and **trustless without exposure**.

## Why FHE Matters

Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows computation on encrypted data ‚Äî meaning the game logic can execute entirely without decryption.  
In a conventional blockchain game:

- Every move and secret is public on-chain.  
- Hidden answers cannot exist without trusting an off-chain server.  
- Gameplay fairness relies on opaque verification.

With FHE:

- The player‚Äôs guesses remain hidden.  
- The answer stays private, known only in encrypted form.  
- The contract performs encrypted comparisons to verify matches.  
- The outcome is publicly verifiable yet does not reveal any sensitive data.

In short, **FHE makes private play on public ledgers possible**.

## Core Features

### üîê Encrypted Gameplay
Every word guess is encrypted locally in the user‚Äôs browser. The encrypted data is sent to the contract, which verifies correctness using FHE operations.

### üß© FHE Verification Engine
Smart contracts can check letter positions, correct letters, and partial matches ‚Äî all without decrypting any data.

### üåê On-Chain Challenge System
Daily challenge words are generated and encrypted on-chain. Each day presents a new puzzle for all players, ensuring fairness and consistency.

### üèÜ Public Scoreboard
Scores, win streaks, and player progress are visible through an aggregated scoreboard ‚Äî but individual guesses and answers remain confidential.

### üïπÔ∏è Web3 Integration
Uses blockchain identities for participation and reward tracking, while maintaining complete separation between wallet addresses and encrypted word data.

### üß† Stateless Smart Contract Design
Contracts handle encrypted verification and scoring but never store plaintext words or clues, reducing attack vectors and ensuring privacy by design.

## Game Flow

1. **Start Challenge** ‚Äî The contract publishes an encrypted target word for the day.  
2. **Make a Guess** ‚Äî The player encrypts a word locally and submits it to the blockchain.  
3. **FHE Evaluation** ‚Äî The contract evaluates the guess entirely on ciphertexts.  
4. **Result Decryption** ‚Äî The contract emits an encrypted feedback result, which the player can decrypt locally.  
5. **Repeat** ‚Äî Players continue guessing until they solve the puzzle or exhaust their attempts.  

All computations occur under encryption ‚Äî no plaintext words ever appear on-chain.

## Architecture

### On-Chain Components

**WordGameFHE.sol**

- Manages encrypted guesses and validations  
- Stores FHE-encrypted daily challenge words  
- Verifies letter matches and positions through FHE computation  
- Records game outcomes and updates encrypted leaderboards  

### Off-Chain Components

**Frontend Application**

- Encrypts player guesses using the same FHE public key used by the smart contract  
- Decrypts feedback using a local private key  
- Displays visual indicators (correct letter, misplaced, wrong) after local decryption  
- Provides a seamless Wordle-style interface for blockchain users

## Technology Stack

### Blockchain Layer
- **Solidity** for smart contracts  
- **FHE-based verification libraries** compiled to work within Ethereum-compatible environments  
- **Hardhat** for contract development and simulation  
- **Ethereum-compatible network** for decentralized deployment  

### Frontend Layer
- **React + TypeScript** for interactive UI  
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling  
- **Ethers.js** for blockchain communication  
- **WebAssembly FHE runtime** for client-side encryption/decryption

## Security and Privacy Model

### End-to-End Encryption
All gameplay data ‚Äî including guesses, answers, and evaluation results ‚Äî is encrypted from end to end. No plaintext ever touches the chain.

### Trustless Verification
Since the validation occurs through FHE operations, the contract does not rely on off-chain oracles or centralized validators.

### Transparency Without Exposure
Game logic is open source and auditable. Anyone can verify the computation steps, but not the encrypted contents.

### Replay Resistance
Each daily challenge uses unique encryption parameters and randomized salts to prevent reverse-engineering of past answers.

### Anti-Cheating Protections
- Encrypted validation ensures no participant can inspect others‚Äô guesses.  
- Randomized FHE parameters protect against ciphertext pattern leaks.  
- Leaderboard scores are computed using encrypted attestations verified by the contract.

## Developer Notes

Developers can integrate new word sets, custom FHE parameter configurations, or extended scoring rules without breaking the privacy model.  
The contract‚Äôs modular design allows new game modes ‚Äî such as time-limited tournaments or team-based play ‚Äî to be added securely.

## Example Scenario (Conceptual)

1. The contract publishes an encrypted word: ‚ÄúAPPLE‚Äù, but represented as ciphertext `C_word`.  
2. Alice guesses ‚ÄúGRAPE‚Äù, encrypted to `C_guess`.  
3. The contract computes the encrypted comparison `Eval(C_guess, C_word)` via FHE.  
4. The result ‚Äî positions and correctness ‚Äî is returned as `C_feedback`.  
5. Alice decrypts `C_feedback` locally to learn she has one correct letter in the right position.  
6. The entire round occurs without anyone, including miners or validators, learning the actual words.

This mechanism demonstrates how **FHE preserves privacy while maintaining verifiable fairness**.

## Design Philosophy

WordGameFHE is not only a fun blockchain puzzle ‚Äî it‚Äôs a research-driven exploration of how **homomorphic encryption can redefine on-chain privacy**.  
It shows that even interactive, multi-step games can exist fully on-chain **without leaking secrets**.

In essence, it merges three worlds:
- **Game design** (fairness, challenge, engagement)  
- **Cryptography** (FHE-powered computation)  
- **Blockchain** (immutability and transparency)  

---

## Limitations and Future Research

- FHE operations remain computationally expensive compared to standard arithmetic.  
- Current implementations may require optimization for gas efficiency.  
- Exploring hybrid models combining FHE with zero-knowledge proofs may reduce cost while maintaining privacy.  
- Future updates may use batching or parallel encryption schemes for scalability.  

---

## Vision

WordGameFHE envisions a new category of **private, trustless Web3 games** ‚Äî where the blockchain provides fairness and transparency, but players retain full control over their personal data.

In this new paradigm:
- **Privacy becomes a game feature**  
- **Cryptography becomes the game engine**  
- **FHE becomes the key to honest fun**

Built with curiosity, math, and the belief that privacy should never come at the cost of play.
